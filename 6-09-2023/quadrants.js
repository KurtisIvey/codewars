/*
Given a point in a Euclidean plane (x and y), return the quadrant the point exists in: 1, 2, 3 or 4 (integer). x and y are non-zero integers, therefore the given point never lies on the axes.

Examples
(1, 2)     => 1
(3, 5)     => 1
(-10, 100) => 2
(-1, -9)   => 3
(19, -56)  => 4
Reference
QuadrantsQuadrants
There are four quadrants:

First quadrant, the quadrant in the top-right, contains all points with positive X and Y
Second quadrant, the quadrant in the top-left, contains all points with negative X, but positive Y
Third quadrant, the quadrant in the bottom-left, contains all points with negative X and Y
Fourth quadrant, the quadrant in the bottom-right, contains all points with positive X, but negative Y

/*
pseudo code

create parameters in which the number will be classified. Can have if statements doing this 
probably the easiest option to come up with
return the quadrant in number val

// time & space complexity of O(1)

function quadrant(x, y) {
  if (x > 0 && y > 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  if (x < 0 && y > 0) {
    return 2;
  }
  if (x < 0 && y < 0) {
    return 3;
  }
  if (x > 0 && y < 0) {
    return 4;
